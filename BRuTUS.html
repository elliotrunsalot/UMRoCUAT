                    <h3>The BTrail</h3>
                    <p><strong>100km/3000m elev. 20hr limit</strong></p>
                    <p>The BTrail is a challenging 100km course starting at Corin Dam and finishing at Blue Range Hut. Athletes will climb 600m up Stockyard Spur in the first 2km as they set out on an epic journey traversing a large portion of the Brindabella Ranges. Up on the range they will visit Mt. Ginini, Mt Franklin (Frankie CP1) and Mt. Aggie, collecting mystery items at the summits as evidence of reaching these high points. Water will be available at Bendora Arboretum WP1.</p>
                    <p>After Bulls Head CP2, runners will leave Mt Franklin road to join Mile Hill Road, and descend to Warks Road. In this section runners will traverse riverside wilderness to a water point at Warks WP2 (WARNING! Fill your bottles here!). This leads into harsh exposed trails in managed forest with blackberry-lined trail and the spirit-destroying climbs of Marshalls Break.</p>
                    <p>Crossing Brindabella road at Wombat Creek CP3, athletes approach the last big climb to the summit of Mt. Coree where they must acquire their fourth mystery object. Athletes must carry their 4 objects for the remainder of the race.</p>
                    <p>Pacers may join their athletes at Wombat Creek CP and continue with them until the finish. Coreezy CP4 is also an option, however we recommend not attempting to access Coree campsite with a 2WD vehicle.</p>
                    <p>After dark departures from the final checkpoint, Knife Point CP, must be accompanied either by a pacer or another athlete. This final section includes the descent known as the Slippery Dip and all athletes must take particular care on this descent.</p>
                    <p>Upon finishing athletes must show their collection of 4 mystery objects to race officials to have their time ratified. In the event that a runner is unable to display a full set of 4 objects their time will be recorded but their place will not be recognised in the official finishing order.</p>

                <div class="textbox2">
        
                    <h3>The BRuTUS</h3>
                    <p><strong>60km/2000m elev. 11hr limit</strong></p>
                    <p>The BRuTUS is a 60km course starting at the historic Blue Range Hut. 
                        It follows One Stick Road, then East West Road before crossing Brindabella Road and continuing into the Cotter Catchment Area.
                        Runners will pass (but not cross) Vanitys Crossing before reaching CP1.
                        After CP1 runners can expect some of the smaller hills before reaching CP2 at Curries Road where they will make the second crossing of Brindabella Road.
                        The major climb of the course is already visible at this point and runners will take Pabral Road into NSW, then Coree Summit Road to the top.
                        After summiting, runners return down the Summit Road to Coree Campground and CP3.
                        What follows is a long and challenging section on Two Sticks Road, followed by Blue Range Road.
                        Runners briefly return to ACT where they will reach CP4 before proceeding back over the border along Genges Trail.
                        Off Genges Trail lies the final obstacle, a sharp rutted Slippery Dip to Radiata Trail. 
                        Heading South on Dead Horse Gate Road, those who have run the GUMBY will find themselves in familiar territory. 
                        A gentle descent brings runners to the finish line at Blue Range Hut.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="imagebox2">

                <div class="textbox3">
                    <h3>The Knife</h3>
                    <p><strong>14km/680m elev. 4hr limit</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Taking in 14km of dirt track with 680m of accumulated elevation pain, the Knife is a mediocre serve of wild radiata pine forest and blackberry. 
                        Runners will head west on Blue Range Road before making a turn for the worst at Poo Bear Corner. 
                        The course screws then pinches on a sharp left leading to a climb known as the Lung Piercer. 
                        After an eternity, the Lung Piercer rejoins Blue Range Road which continues to climb to Knife Point aid station where runners who refuse to surrender will be grimly directed to the Genges Trail descent. 
                        Here the Knife joins the BRuTUS, and BTrail courses. If the lung peircer felt like something you hadn't prepared for, then at least the descent shouldn't surprise you.
                        Eventually the Genges trail flattens out and the route ahead looks like an easy run. But that's not where you're going. 
                        Good luck.

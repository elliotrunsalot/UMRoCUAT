            <p>Inspired by the knife-like elevation profile of Mt. Coree, the stunning views over the Cotter, and an unrelated coup d'etat that happened in 44BCE, the BRuTUS 60km and The Knife 14km are set to return in 2024 and they are bringing a mate full of deceit, The BTrail 100km.</p>
            <p>ULTRA Mediocre Runners of Canberra Incorporated welcomes you to enjoy the second edition of their October ultra-distance trail race, which, though challenging, probably will not bear any particular semblance to an historical event in which a tyrant's senators, including his closest ally, stabbed him 23 times. 
            <p>There are three opportunities for runners to either push beyond 50kms, or power through a sharp 15km: courses that, dramatic as they are, will not necessarily be the kind of thing Shakespeare would have written a play about. </p>

                    <h3>The BTrail</h3>
                    <p><strong>100km/3000m elev. 20hr limit</strong></p>
                    <p>The BTrail is a challenging 100km course starting at Corin Dam and finishing at Blue Range Hut. Athletes will climb 600m up Stockyard Spur in the first 2km as they set out on an epic journey traversing a large portion of the Brindabella Ranges. Up on the range they will visit Mt. Ginini, Mt Franklin (Frankie CP1) and Mt. Aggie, collecting anodized nuts of different colours at the summits as evidence of reaching these high points. Water will be available at Bendora Arbo WP1.</p>
                    <p>After Bulls Head CP2, runners will leave Mt Franklin road to join Mile Hill Road, and descend to Warks Road. In this section runners will traverse riverside wilderness to a water point at Warks WP2 before moving into harsher managed forest with blackberry-lined trail and the spirit-breaking climbs of Marshalls Break.</p>
                    <p>Crossing Brindabella road at Wombat Creek CP3, athletes approach the last big climb to the summit of Mt. Coree where they must acquire their fourth nut. Athletes must hold onto their 4 nuts for the remainder of the race.</p>
                    <p>Pacers may join their athletes at Wombat Creek CP and continue with them until the finish. Coreezy CP4 is also an option, however we recommend not attempting to access Coree campsite with a 2WD vehicle.</p>
                    <p>After dark departures from the final checkpoint, Knife Point CP, must be accompanied either by a pacer or another athlete. This final section includes the descent known as the Slippery Dip and all athletes must take particular care on this descent.</p>
                    <p>Upon finishing athletes must show their nuts to race officials to have their time ratified. In the event that a runner is unable to display a full set of 4 nuts their time will be recorded but their place will not be recognised in the official finishing order.</p>

                    <h3>The BRuTUS</h3>
                    <p><strong>60km/2000m elev. 11hr limit</strong></p>
                    <p>The BRuTUS is a 60km course starting at the historic Blue Range Hut. 
                        It follows One Stick Road, then East West Road before crossing Brindabella Road and continuing into the Cotter Catchment Area.
                        Runners will pass (but not cross) Vanitys Crossing before reaching CP1.
                        After CP1 runners can expect some of the smaller hills before reaching CP2 at Curries Road where they will make the second crossing of Brindabella Road.
                        The major climb of the course is already visible at this point and runners will take Pabral Road into NSW, then Coree Summit Road to the top.
                        After summiting runners return down the Summit Road to Coree Campground and CP3.
                        What follows is a long and challenging section on Two Sticks Road, followed by Blue Range Road.
                        Runners briefly return to ACT where they will reach CP4 before proceeding back over the border along Genges Trail.
                        Off Genges Trail lies the final obstacle, a sharp rutted Slippery Dip to Radiata Trail. 
                        Heading South on Dead Horse Gate Road, those who have run the GUMBY will find themselves in familiar territory. 
                        A gentle descent brings runners to the finish line at Blue Range Hut.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Knife</h3>
                    <p><strong>14km/680m elev. 4hr limit</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Taking in 14km of dirt track with 680m of accumulated elevation pain, the Knife is a mediocre serve of wild radiata pine forest and blackberry. 
                        Runners will head west on Blue Range Road before making a turn for the worst at Poo Bear Corner. 
                        The course screws then pinches on a sharp left leading to a climb known as the Lung Piercer. 
                        After an eternity, the Lung Piercer rejoins Blue Range Road which continues to climb to Knife Point aid station where runners who refuse to surrender will be directed grimly by a marshall to begin the descent of Genges Trail. 
                        Here the Knife joins the BRuTUS course come together. If the lung peircer felt like something you hadn't prepared for, then at least if wont be a surprise that you didn't prepare for the descent before you either.
                        If the drops in altitude seem sharp and technical, you can be comforted by the fact that you're doing this with 50kms less in your legs than everyone in the BRuTUS.
                        Eventually the trail flattens out and the route ahead looks like an easy run.
                        But that's not where you're going. 
                        Good luck.

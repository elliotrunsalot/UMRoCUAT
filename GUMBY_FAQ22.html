    <h2>GUMBY T-Shirts.</h2>
    
    <p>As part of the inaugural GUMBY we’re offering entrants the opportunity to purchase a once-off GUMBY running tee at cost price for just $45. You’ve seen the sweet, sweet shirts those ULTRA Mediocre guys get around in and had the thought, “I don’t know what that is but I want one!” Entering the GUMBY or GUMBaby gives you the opportunity to order a sweet shirt of your very own, with a GUMBY twist.</p>
    <p>These Champion System shirts are perfect for running long and perfecter for running longerer. Your GUMBY memorabilia t-shirt will get noticed whether on the road or the trail. It’ll be the ultimate conversation starter at a party or on casual Friday at the office. Impress your boss, friends, colleagues and strangers with your stories of how you were there, you ran the laps, you showed your teeth and your grit in a race that was so tough only one person finished.</p>

<div class="faq">
    
    <div class="question">
        <p>Should I sign up for the GUMBY or the GUMBaby?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>I know, it's hard. I wish I could do both races at the same time, too. If you think 53km is a long way to run then the GUMBaby might be your race. If you don’t like stopping, then the GUMBY is probably your thing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>What is a Last One Standing race?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Simple. You run 6.7km every hour for as many hours as you can. Only the person who runs the most laps finishes the race.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>How do I win?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>For the GUMBY, see previous answer. The runner who “helps” the finisher do the most laps will receive an “assist” award. All non-finishers (including the assist) receive a DNF race token. The finisher will receive a free entry to next year’s race. The assist (last person to DNF) will receive a 50% discount on next year’s entry.</p>
        <p>For the GUMBaby, it comes down to the last lap. You run 7 laps at whatever pace you like, and as long as you’re on that start line every hour you can keep going. Then you run the last lap as fast as you can: 1st female and 1st male are declared winners, 2nd female and 2nd male are the “assists”. All who cross the finish line receive a finisher’s token.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Is there mobile or internet coverage at Blue Range Hut?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>The Hut sits in a valley and mobile reception and internet are patchy at best. The most reliable mobile reception in the vicinity is at the out and back turn around point on One Stick Road (we call this Facebook Hill). Spectators and crew may walk to this location. Alternatively, crew can also drive 10-15 minutes towards Uriarra Village to find reception.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>How many people can I have in my support crew?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>This may be dependant on restrictions on overall numbers and we will update you as race day approches. For participants who will be running through the night, plan on having only have 1 support person camping.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>How do I book my campsite?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>The booking can be made during the entry process.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Are cooking facilities available?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes. There will be hot water for your noodles, and a gas BBQ for your veggie sausage. We'll fire the barbie up on the first night, then as needed thereafter. Supporters can use the BBQ to cook a meal, but a camp stove is worth bringing. Treat it like a camping trip.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Will there be food and water available?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>We will have some aid station food available for GUMBY participants and we will truck in some town water for use by participants of both races. There is tank water on site although we do not recommend drinking it without boiling first.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Should I bring my own food?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes. You’ll be burning a ton of calories, so bring food especially things you like to eat (or think you can stomach), on a very long run. There'll be sangas and soup for volunteers, runners and designated support crew. Please be aware that this hot food should not be relied upon as your main food source. Treat it like a camping trip and bring what you need.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Where can I get more food?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>The nearest large shops are at Cooleman Court in Weston Creek, 45 minutes away. There you will find supermarkets as well as several take away options.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Can I have a campfire?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Fires are permitted only in the designated fire pits. You are not permitted to collect firewood in the nature reserve. We will have firewood available for the main fire around the hut, but if you want to use one of the other fire pits we suggest you bring some wood with you.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Where can I park?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>While it is possible to park inside the locked gate, you should plan to park outside the gate along the side of the access road. People should only request to park inside the gate if they’re not planning to leave until the end. Spaces are very limited and the gate will be locked before the start of the race.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Can I bring my caravan?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>No. Blue Range Hut is set up for tent camping only. Space is limited so please don’t pitch a tent that is a house.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Can I bring my dog/s?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Although dogs are technically permitted at Blue Range Hut, we ask that you do not bring your dog on race day.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Can I dispose of rubbish at the Hut?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Please take all your rubbish with you and pick up any litter around your campsite when you pack up. We have to ensure that the entire area is rubbish free when we leave.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Are toilets available?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes. There are 2 pit toilets opposite the Hut.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Are showers available?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>No. Don't worry, you smell great.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Are entries refundable or transferable?</p>
    </div>

            <p>Requests for refunds must be emailed to the organiser at <a href=mailto:info@ultramediocre.run>info@ultramediocre.run</a></p>
            <p>If you cannot participate in the event for any reason, entry fee refunds are available in accordance with the below-stated withdrawal dates only. After the stipulated dates, entry fees are non-refundable for withdrawals initiated by the athlete.</p>
            <p>Where eligible, please allow up to 30 business days for your refund to be processed. The refund is automatically issued to the credit card originally used to pay for the registration. If that card has since been cancelled or has expired it is the athlete’s responsibility to notify us when requesting the eligible refund.</p>
            <ul>- Until 90 days prior (12am) — 75% of entry fee refundable for athlete withdrawal requests made up to this date.</ul>

            <p>Transfer of entry to different race</p>

        <div class="answer">
            <p>Requests for transfers from one event to another must be emailed to the organiser at <a href=mailto:info@ultramediocre.run>info@ultramediocre.run</a> on or before the close of entries.</p>
            <p> Transfers between event distances can be requested until the first of:
            <ul>- The event distance sells out, or</ul>
            <ul>- The close of entries</ul>
            <p>Transfers between event distances are subject to the following terms:</p>
            <ul>- The athlete pays the difference where they transfer to race of higher cost. The race fee at the time of transfer applies (i.e. if the athlete enters a lower cost race during the early entry period and transfers to a higher cost race during the standard entry period, they will not retain the right to be charged the early entry fee of the distance to which they transfer.)</ul>
            <ul>- The athlete forfeits the difference where they transfer to a less expensive race.</ul>

        <!-- GUMBY IS -->
       
	    <h2>The Event</h2>
        <p>
            The 2023 GUMBY, GumBABY and GumbyMOON will take place in the Brindabella Ranges to the west of Canberra.
            The event promises a vibrant community atmosphere for runners and supporters while camping at the historic Blue Range Hut.
        </p>
        <p>The races are organised by ULTRA Mediocre Runners of Canberra Incorporated, a not for profit sports club furthering the sport of ultrarunning in Canberra and surrounds.</p>
        
        <!-- Race Descriptions -->
        <h2>The Races</h2>
        <p>The GUMBY, starting on the Saturday morning, is a traditional last one standing race on a 6.7km course. Runners complete a lap on the hour every hour until there is only one person standing. Everyone else receives a DNF. We expect the race to go all night and into the next day.
        </p>
        
        <p>The GumBABY will be 8 laps of the GUMBY course beginning on the Sunday morning and run out of sync with the GUMBY. The total distance is 53.6km. The winner of the race will be the first person across the line on lap 8.
        </p>
        <p>Our newest addition to the family is the GumbyMOON, a four lap race held on Friday afternoon and into the night. The total distance is 26.8km and is perfect for anyone who wants to try the LOS format or have a shot at night running. The winner of the race will be the first person across the line on lap 4.
        </p>
	  
	    <!-- <h2>GUMBY Prizes</h2>
        <p>The Last Female Standing and the Last Male Standing will both receive free entry to defend their titles at GUMBY 2024.</p>
         -->
	    <h2>DNFers</h2>
        <p>All participants that don't finish the GUMBY will receive a Quitters Bitter as well as something to remember all that suffering, and of course, they will get to ‘enjoy’ the famous Quitters Ceremony!</p>

        <!-- course description -->
 

   
        <h2>The Course</h2> 
        <p>In 2021 athletes ran the course clockwise. In 2022 athletes ran the course anti-clockwise. In 2023, the direction will be revealed on the Friday morning of GUMBY weekend.</p>
        <p>The course is 6.7kms of undulating fire trail. Regardless of direction, runners will start in a corral at Blue Range Hut and exit the camp ground through the north gate.</p> 
    
        <h3>Clockwise course description</h3>
        <p>It's about 300m from the corral to the north gate. From the gate, runners will travel up Blue Range Road to a sharp right turn known as Poo Bear Corner. 
        The course climbs to the north then descends through a colonnade of trees to Dead Horse Gate Road.</p>
        <p>Runners exit to the right where they crest Mt. GUMBY and enjoy panoramic views with Black Mountain in the distance before descending to Pissing Contest Point.</p>
        <p>The course winds right and left before ascending to Facebook Hill where runners turn left for a short out-and-back along Gumbilical lane.</p>
        <p>Returning to Facebook Hill, runners again turn left down a rocky slope to the north gate of the campsite and on to the corral.</p> 
        

        <h3>Anti-clockwise course description</h3>
        <p>From the corral runners head through the north gate and turn right up a rocky slope to Facebook Hill. They continue to the right for a short out-and-back on Gumbilical Lane.</p> 
        <p>Upon returning to Facebook Hill runners turn right and descend a wide road. The trail weaves right then left before a climb to Pissing Contest Point where runners keep left at the fork to ascend Mt. GUMBY where they will enjoy views of the mountains and forrest of Coree, then continue on a gentle descent to Dead Horse Gate Road.</p>  
        <p>Runners will climb again and wind their way south before turning sharply to the left at Poo Bear Corner onto Blue Range Road, which will take them directly back to the north gate and on to the corral. </p>

         <!-- rules -->
        
        <h2>The Rules</h2>
        <p>Runners run the same course in the same direction once every hour. At the beginning of each hour runners who intend to continue must be in the corral next to Blue Range Hut. Any runners late to the corral will receive a DNF (all races).</p>
            
        <h3>The GUMBY</h3>        
            <ul>
            <li>Runners will start a 6.71 km (4.17 mile) on the hour, every hour</li>
            <li>Runners must finish each lap within 1 hour</li>
            <li>Each loop starts precisely 1 hour after the last</li>
            <li>Runners are called into the starting corral at 3 minutes to the hour</li>
            <li>Runners must be in the starting corral at the lap start bell, and start running on the bell (no late starts)</li>
            <li>Any runner not in the starting corral for any lap is not eligible to continue and is recorded as DNF (did not finish)</li>
            <li>Any runner who fails to finish a lap is recorded as DNF (did not finish)</li>
            <li>No artificial aids (including trekking poles)</li>
            <li>Slower runners must allow passes</li>
            <li>This continues until only one runner can complete the lap within the 1-hour time limit</li>
            <li>Except for toilet stops competitors may not leave the course until each loop is completed</li>
            <li>No non-competitors on the course (including eliminated runners)</li>
            <li>No personal aid during a loop (common aid stations are allowed)</li>
            <li>Each loop must be completed within an hour to be counted, including the final lap</li>         
            <li>If no runner can complete one more loop than anyone else, there is no winner</li>
            <li>The winner is the last person to complete a loop</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The GumBABY and GumbyMOON</h3>
            <p>Rules are the same for the GumBABY and GumbyMOON, however the winner will be decided by a race on the last lap. Whoever completes the final loop first wins. All others who finish within the time frame will be recognised as finishers instead of receiving a DNF.</p>

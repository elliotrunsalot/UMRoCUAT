        <h2>Our Beginnings</h2>
        <p>
            In 2020 the world was shutting down. A few Canberra runners were thinking about going long, but with the threat of Covid-19 transmissions, one by one the events began to drop from the calander. The last straw was the Canberra 24 and 48-Hour Track Race at the Australian Institute of Sport. We believed it would go ahead, but then the word came down: the AIS needed to reserve its resources for elite athletes. Elite! Apparently, running for 24 or 48 hours was the territory of the mediocre.

            And so, in that moment of being deemed not quite good enough for the big leagues' training grounds, the Ultra Mediocre Runners of Canberra or UMRoC was born. A tongue-in-cheek moniker for a group who, while perhaps not gracing the Olympic podium, certainly weren't slouches. We embraced the irony, the absurdity, and the camaraderie and set about conquering mountains and setting records elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an establishing action we made our mark on the Canberra Centenary Trail (we just call it the 'Cent'), a 145km loop around our capital city, claiming FKTs in the supported and unsupported categories. Today all FKTs on this majestic loop are held by UMRoC members.

            Then came the T-shirts followed by incorporation as an associated sports club on 27 January, 2021, ostensibly to look serious enough to be permitted to organise our first public-facing event, a last-one-standing christened the Great Ultra Mediocre Back Yarder, or the GUMBY.

            In 2023 UMRoC premiered it's second public-facing event, the Brindabella Ranges ultimate Trail Ultra Spectacular, with 14km (the Knife) and 60km distances. In 2024 with much pride, we added a 100km distance (the B-Trail), which takes in the best of the Brindabella Ranges in the west of the ACT. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Our members show a lot of pluck in their mediocrity, and we honor them with club nicknames which in some way arise from their running exploits. We are UMRoC and we run far. And in running far continue to learn the lesson that if you're not mediocre, you just haven't run far enough.

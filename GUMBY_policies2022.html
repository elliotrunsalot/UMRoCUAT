        <div class="answer">
            <p>For those that miss out an entry, a waitlist will be established. The price of
                your entry will be determined by the date you were added to the waitlist.
                For example, if you registered in October during the early bird period, but
                you were not offered an entry until March, you would still pay the early bird
                price.</p>

            <p>Where eligible, please allow up to 30 business days for your refund to be

                expired it is the athlete’s responsibility to notify us when requesting the
                eligible refund.

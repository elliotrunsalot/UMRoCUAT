            The 2022 GUMBY and GUMBaby will take place in the Brindabella Ranges to the west of Canberra.
            The event promises a vibrant community atmosphere for runners and supporters with camping at the historic Blue Range Hut.
        </p>
        <p> 
            The races are organised by ULTRA Mediocre Runners of Canberra Incorporated, a not for profit sports club furthering the sport of ultrarunning in Canberra and surrounds.

        <h2>
            The Races
        </h2>
        <p>
            The GUMBY is a traditional last one standing race on a 6.7km course. Runners complete a lap on the hour every hour until there is only one person standing. Everyone else receives a DNF. We expect the race to go all night, and for some, into the next day.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The GUMBaby will be 8 laps of the GUMBY course run out of sync with the GUMBY beginning on the Sunday morning. The total distance is 53.6km. The winner of the race will be the first person across the line on lap 8.

<!-- course description -->
 
<div class="course22">
   
    <h2>The Course</h2> 
    <p>In 2021 athletes ran the course clockwise. The 2022 course direction will be announced closer to race day.</p>
    <p>The course is 6.7kms of undulating fire trail. Regardless of direction, runners will start in a corral at Blue Range Hut and exit the camping ground through the north gate.</p> 

    <h2>Clockwise</h2>
    <p>From the north gate runners continue straight along Blue Range Road for a short distance before turning sharply to the right.</p> 
    <p>The fire trail will continue up hill and around some bends. At the first fork in the road runners keep left and continue to 
        the northernmost point of the loop - the top of GUMBY's head - where they will enjoy the best views of the course before 
        descending to the location known as the GUMBY pissing contest. A long sweeping bend rises to a sharp turn to the south which 
        leads runners on to the ascent of Facebook Hill (named for its more reliable mobile reception)</p>  
    <p>Runners will come to a wide 3-way inersection at the top of a rise and turn left for a short out-and-back down Gumbilical Lane, 
        returning to Facebook Hill, runners keep left for a rocky descent to the north gate of the camp. The lap ends where it started 
        in the corral at Blue Range Hut.</p>
    
    <h2>Anti-Clockwise</h2>
    <p>From the north gate runners turn right up a rocky slope to Facebook Hill and continue to the right down the out and back on Gumbilical Lane.</p> 
    <p>Returning to Facebook Hill runners will turn right and descend a wide road. After a few sharp corners and a climb, runners will 
        come to a fork at the GUMBY pissing contest where they will take the left road to climb to the top of GUMBY's head.</p>
    <p>Here runners can enjoy the best views of the course before descending to Dead Horse Gate Road.</p>  
    <p>Runners will climb again and wind their way south before arriving back at Blue Range Road. Here they will turn sharply to the left 
        and follow Blue Range Road directly back to the north gate, and finish the lap in the corral.</p>

<!-- rules -->
<div class="rules22">
    <h2>
        The Rules
    </h2>
    
    <p>Runners run the same course in the same direction once every hour. At the beginning of each hour runners who intend to continue must be in the corral next to Blue Range Hut. Any runners late to the corral will receive a DNF (both races).</p>
<h3>The GUMBY</h3>
        
<ul>
    <li>Runners will start a 6.71 km (4.17 mile) on the hour, every hour</li>
            <li>Runners must finish each lap within 1 hour</li>
            <li>Each loop starts precisely 1 hour after the last</li>
            <li>Runners are called into the starting corral at 3 minutes to the hour</li>
            <li>Runners must be in the starting corral at the lap start bell, and start running on the bell (no late starts)</li>
            <li>Any runner not in the starting corral for any lap is not eligible to continue and is recorded as DNF (did not finish)</li>
            <li>Any runner who fails to finish a lap is recorded as DNF (did not finish)</li>
            <li>No artificial aids (including trekking poles)</li>
            <li>Slower runners must allow passes</li>
            <li>This continues until only one runner can complete the lap within the 1-hour time limit</li>
            <li>Except for toilet stops competitors may not leave the course until each loop is completed</li>
            <li>No non-competitors on the course (including eliminated runners)</li>
            <li>No personal aid during a loop (common aid stations are allowed)</li>
            <li>Each loop must be completed within an hour to be counted, including the final lap</li>         
            <li>If no runner can complete one more loop than anyone else, there is no winner</li>
            <li>The winner is the last person to complete a loop</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>
            The GUMBaby
        </h3>
        <p>Rules are the same for the GUMBaby, however the winner will be decided by a race on the last lap. Whoever completes the 8th loop first wins. All others who finish within the time frame will be recognized as finishers instead of receiving a DNF.

    <p>Welcome to the 2022 Ultra Mediocre Runners of Canberra – Great Ultra Mediocre Back Yarder, or the GUMBY.</p>
    <p>We are excited to be returning with the GUMBY (and GumBABY) for a second year. Whether you are returning for a second year, or standing on the start line for the first time, the event will test you in ways you never thought possible.</p>
    <p>Ultra Mediocre Runners of Canberra (UMROC) is a not-for-profit club and all funds we receive will go back into ultra-running in our community.</p>
    <h2>Message from the President</h2>
    <p>As President of ULTRA Mediocre I am excited to see the GUMBY entering it’s second year. I believe GUMBY epitomises the pursuit of mediocrity.
    <p>Centred around the heritage-listed remains of a World War II Italian internment camp, the Blue Range camp is a very popular camping and events location.  Blue Range Hut is also a great base for accessing some of the glorious alpine walking trails of northern Namadgi National Park.</p>
    <p>A back yard ultra’s only requirement of participants is to run 6.7km an hour, something that is achievable for most runners. As the race effectively begins again every hour any advantage a non-mediocre runner gains by running fast evaporates at the start of every new hour.</p>
    <p>At ULTRA Mediocre, we believe that anyone can be mediocre. If you’re not then you probably haven’t run far enough.</p>
    <p>I wish everyone a fun and enjoyable weekend in the endless pursuit of mediocrity.<p>
    <p>May the most mediocre among us finish!</p>
    <p>Matt Griggs</p>
    <p>UMROC President</p>

    <h2>Message from the Race Director</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the second Great Ultra Mediocre Back Yarder.  On behalf of the race operations team and all the volunteers, we hope you enjoy both races this year.   This year's event promises to build on the success of Ultra Mediocre’s debut event last year, while still maintaining the relaxed feel of the event, mixed with the appropriate level of fun and frivolity.
    <p>We have split the events this year to make the GUMBY the true battle of mind and endurance it is.  At the same time we hope the moving of the GumBABY to the Sunday, will bring renewed hype and excitement to the event site as the GUMBY warriors push their limits.</p>
    <p>This guide contains information you need ahead of the race.  I ask you to take the time to read it and understand it.  Please keep an eye on the GUMBY website and Facebook page for any last minute updates and reminders.</p>
    <p>Whether you are joining us to run 8 laps or 48, we wish you all the best, and make sure you tell your friends all about UMROC and the GUMBY.
    <p>Aaron Broughton</p>
    <p>GUMBY Race Director</p>

    <h2>Tailwind Nutrition</h2>
    <p>Ultra Mediocre are proud to welcome Tailwind Nutrition to the event this year as our inaugural GUMBY sponsor.</p>
    <p>Tailwind Nutrition provides all the energy electrolytes you need to go all day.  No juggling gels, pills or chews – just pour, shake and go.</p>
    <p>While most drinks require you to supplement calories and do not provide anywhere near the electrolytes needed to replace what you sweat out; Tailwind’s fuel can meet your complete calorie needs, and regular consumption gives you steady energy all day.</p>
    <p>Tailwind also has a full complement of electrolytes that mimic the composition and proportions of sweat, meaning there is no need to supplement separate electrolytes.</p>
    <p>Look out over the race weekend for Mandarin Orange Flavoured Tailwind which will be available, as well as random giveaways and spot prizes.</p>
    <p>Also as part of the sponsorship Tailwind Nutrition is offering 15 per cent off all orders from their website during the period 23 March through 7 May. To take advantage of this offer visit <a href="https://www.tailwindnutrition.com.au/">tailwindnutrition.com.au/</a> and use discount code: GUMBYTAIL15%</p>
    
    <h2>Blue Range Hut</h2>
    <p>UMROC welcomes you to the historic Blue Range Hut in the hills to the west of Canberra.</p>
    <p>Centred around the heritage-listed remains of a World War II Italian internment camp, the Blue Range camp is a very popular camping and event location.  Blue Range Hut is also a great base for accessing some of the glorious alpine walking trails of northern Namadgi National Park.</p>
    <p>Blue Range Hut is an approximate 50 minute drive from Canberra City with all but the last few kilometres on sealed roads.  Access to the event site is generally fine in a 2WD car, but may be a little slippery if we have had some rain.  Drive to the conditions and don’t destroy the roads.</p>
    <p>We strongly encourage all people travelling to the campsite to use Blue Range Road rather than East West Road.  East West Road is narrow and has two small creek crossings.  Blue Range Road is generally much better for 2WD vehicles.</p>
    <p>Where possible thought should be given to car-pooling, to reduce the amount of traffic and assist with parking management.</p>
    <p>A map of the event site, course and driving directions from Parliament House can be found <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=14tH_krUggn3CxdZibYHtVzxcrfJ65Cfm&usp=sharing%20link%20" class="access">at this link</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>For the enjoyment of the event and fellow competitors and spectators we require you leave your four legged friends at home during the event.</strong></p>

    </div>

    <h2>COVID-19</h2>
    <p>We are fortunate the current situation in the ACT (and Australia) allows us to proceed with the event.  However, the threat of COVID-19 is still present.  We ask all individuals attending the event site over the weekend comply with the following.</p>
    <p><strong>Do Not Attend If You Have Symptoms</strong>– individuals should not attend if they are showing any symptoms that could potentially be COVID-19.</p>
    <p><strong>Sanitise</strong>– There will be hand sanitisation units throughout the Campground for use by participants, spectators, volunteers and officials.</p>
    
    <h2>Weather</h2>
    <p>While everyone will be hoping for picture postcard weather, what we have noticed from our site visits is the weather at Blue Range Hut can vary drastically.</p>
    <p>Weather averages in Canberra for April are maximums of 20 and minimums of 7.  However out in the hills, you can expect cooler nights.</p>
    <p>It is important you come prepared for icy nights, wet weather and unseasonably warm days.  You don’t want your event to be brought undone by the conditions.</p>
    <p>It is highly recommended you are prepared with warm clothing for the conclusion of your event and between laps. You will rapidly cool down at the end of each lap (many LOS runners have been known to wear a sleeping bag between laps).</p>

    <div class="heroAG">
        <img src="BlueRangeDiagram.png" class="campimg" alt="Blue Range camp diagram">
    </div>

    <p><strong>We also require all participants in the GUMBY to give thought to how they will ensure they stay warm and dry if they withdraw during the night.  There will be a communal campfire, however competitors should ensure they have appropriate clothing, sleeping and shelter (tent etc).  While there is a hut at the campsite, during the event the hut is exclusively for the use of the event staff and first aid providers, unless there is an emergency.</strong></p>
    
    <h2>Campsite</h2>
    <p>The campsite at Blue Range Hut offers plenty of space to camp and spread out.  The campsite is divided into two sections.  The Swamps of Sadness, and the Grass is Always Greener.</p>
    <p>The Swamps of Sadness is reserved exclusively for the GUMBY runners.  This area is closest to the course.   This area has been marked out into 3mx3m squares.  We ask that you take up no more than the following amount of space:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Support for 1 or 2 runners (one 3mx3m area)</li>
        <li>Support for 3 or 4 runners (two 3mx3m areas)</li>
        <li>Support for 5 or more runners (max three 3mx3m areas)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are a group of runners who want more space than is afforded by three 3x3 areas we ask you set up in the main Grass is always Greener section.</p>
    <p>The Grass is Always Greener section is open for you to set up wherever you like.</p>
    <p>GumBABY runners can set up their pit sites in the Grass is Always Greener section. There is no camping for GumBABY runners on Saturday night, but you are encouraged to stay Sunday night and support the end of the GUMBY.</p>
    <p><strong>No Dogs - For the enjoyment of the event and fellow competitors and spectators we require you leave your four legged friends at home during the event.  Anyone bringing dogs will be asked to leave.  If you are linked to a participant, refusal to leave will result in that runner’s disqualification.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Be self-sufficient!</strong> – Blue Range Hut is a campsite with limited provisions. Please bring everything you will need for your race and your stay, if you are camping. There is no running water or electricity at the hut.</p>
    <p><strong>Respect the Environment</strong> – As a club existing to further the sport of ultra and trail running, the Ultra Mediocre Runners of Canberra take great responsibility in leaving the environment as we found it.  There are no bins at Blue Range Hut.  Please take all your rubbish home with you.</p>
    <p><strong>Water</strong> – Please bring all the water you think you will need (for drinking, cooking, washing socks etc.) then double it. We will have limited water available at the hut.  These provisions should not be relied upon.</p>
    <p><strong>Tailwind Nutrition</strong> – UMROC, though our sponsorship with Tailwind Nutrition will have supplies of Mandarin Orange Flavoured Tailwind Nutrition for competitors.  While Tailwind Nutrition have been very generous for an event of our size, we don’t have unlimited supplies.  UMROC asks you consider your fellow competitors and not base all your nutrition sources on the supplied Tailwind.  We welcome you to supplement your own nutrition plans, and try it out if you haven’t used Tailwind previously.</p>
    <p><strong>Food</strong> – Bring all your race food needs. Also bring all your regular camping food and food for your support crew.  We will provide some basic provisions (think tea, coffee, Milo, instant noodles etc.)  However, in keeping with the environmental focus of the event, we will not be supplying any single use cups or cutlery.</p>
    <p><strong>Camping equipment</strong> – please bring all the equipment you will need for camping. GUMBY runners will have a designated area where they can set up camp limited to 3mx3m per entrant. However, there is plenty of space away from the course for non-runners and those that wish to have more space. Note, there is no vehicle camping available at the hut or campground.</p>
    <p><strong>Cooking facilities</strong> – We encourage support crews to bring their own to support their athletes, however, there is a gas BBQ on site and we will provide a basic camp stove and kettle for individuals to use.</p>
    <p><strong>Power</strong> – There is no electricity and thus, no charging options available. You will need to have enough battery power to get you through your entire stay. This includes lighting your camp site. There will be some communal lighting around the hut, but your crew zone will not have light, so make sure your crew has a head torch.  If you want to run a generator please be considerate of the noise and fumes it makes, and where possible limit its use during the night.</p>
    <p><strong>Rubbish</strong> – There are no bins at Blue Range Hut. We are required to remove every last piece of rubbish before we leave the site. So please secure your rubbish and take it home with you at the end of the event.</p>

    <h2>Parking</h2>
    <p>At all times where a volunteer is present, please park as per their instructions.  We will attempt to maximise the amount of parking for GUMBY participants inside the campground gate.  However, the campsite area has limited parking available, and will fill up quickly.</p>
    <p>Where possible thought should be given to car-pooling, to reduce the amount of traffic.</p>
    <p>Participants will be able to drop off equipment near the hut from 1500 until 1900 on Friday and again from 0530 until 0730 Saturday morning.</p>

    <div class="heroAG">
        <img src="ParkingDiagram.png" class="campimg" alt="Parking locations at Gumby event">
    </div>

    <p>If the parking is full inside the campsite gate, overflow parking is approximately 600m walk to the hut, on Blue Range Road.</p>
    <p>If you park inside the hut grounds inside the gate you will only be able to leave upon request (the Race Director will organise someone to let you out as soon as they can, most likely at a quiet time after runners have commenced a lap).</p>
    <p>We suggest arriving with plenty of time to drop off your gear and move your car to a parking spot.  There is to be no parking on East-West Road.</p>
    <p>On the Sunday morning for the GumBABY, you will be able to drop off equipment near the hut from 0530 until 0730. It is highly likely that most GumBABY participants will need to park back on Blue Range Road and walk to the race site.</p>

    <h2>The Rules</h2>
    <h3>The GUMBY</h3>
    <p><strong>safety gear – you will need at minimum a head torch and a reflective high visibility vest if you are running after 5pm, through to 7am.  If you do not have these items you will not be allowed to commence any laps after 5pm.  The vest must have reflective strips.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Runners will start a 6.71 km (4.17 mile) lap on the hour, every hour until only one runner is left and able to complete a solo lap.</li>
        <li>Runners run the same course in the same direction once every hour. </li>
        <li>Runners must finish each lap within 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Each lap starts precisely 1 hour after the last.</li>
        <li>Runners will be called into the starting corral at 3 minutes prior to the commencement of the next lap.</li>
        <li>Runners must be in the starting corral upon commencement of the lap and must start running on the bell (no late starts).  It is the responsibility of the runner and their support crew to ensure they are in the corral in time.</li>
        <li>Any runner not in the starting corral for any lap is not eligible to continue and is recorded as DNF (did not finish).</li>
        <li>Any runner who fails to finish a lap is recorded as DNF</li>
        <li>No artificial aids (including trekking poles).</li>
        <li>Each runner is encouraged to carry a mobile phone with them, while reception is patchy it is available at certain points on the course.  All runners will be provided with the phone number for the satellite phone that will be at the hut in case of emergencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Headlamps/torches and a high visibility reflective vest are required between 1700 and 0700 – No Exceptions. The vest must have reflective strips.</strong> You can buy these from Bunnings for a few dollars.  Runners whose vests does not have reflective strips will not be allowed onto the course.</li>
        <li><strong>No headphones are allowed at any time</strong> – due to the event being held on public roads.</li>
        <li>Except for toilet stops competitors may not leave the course until each lap is completed.</li>
        <li>Any competitor seen littering will be disqualified.  If you take something on a lap, make sure it comes back. It’s not hard to stuff a gel packet in a pocket.</li>
        <li>No non-competitors on the course (including previously eliminated runners).  While we are all about encouraging athletes, this is an individual challenge.</li>
        <li>If no runner can complete one more lap than anyone else, there is no winner.</li>
        <li>The winner is the last person to successfully complete a lap.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The GumBABY</h3>
    <p>Rules are the same for the GumBABY with the following exceptions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The winner will be decided by a race on the last lap. Whoever completes the eighth lap first wins.</li>
        <li>All others who finish within the time frame will be recognized as finishers instead of receiving a DNF.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h2>The GUMBY Course</h2>
    <div class="heroAG">
        <img src="CourseMap.png" class="campimg" alt="Glorious view from Mt Gumby">
    </div>

    <p><strong>In 2022 we are going backwards!! (Anti-clockwise)</strong></p>
    <p>It’s only 6.71km how hard can it be?  It might not be on laps one and two, but how many times can you continue to get around the GUMBY.</p>
    <p>The course is 6.71km of undulating fire trail (all formed roads) offering a tasteful 180m of vertical gain per lap.</p>
    <p>The course begins in front of Blue Range Hut and exits the camping ground to the north gate – watch out for the locked gate about 150m in.  After about 200m you will turn right onto One Stick Road and begin a nasty climb approximately 500m in length to Facebook Hill. At Facebook Hill turn right onto the out and back section on Gumbilical Lane.  Run along Gumbilical lane for 300m to the turnaround point and make your way back to One Stick Road.</p>
    <p>Turn right upon returning to One Stick Road and enjoy its undulations (ignoring all side roads) for approximately one kilometre.</p>
    <p>At this point there will be a fork in the road. <strong>This is the one point of the course where it is the easiest to take the wrong path so pay attention.</strong> Take the LEFT fork onto Burnt Knob Road. Here begins the real climbing as you make your ascent to the Mt Gumby KOM point. Follow Burnt Knob Road for approximately one kilometre (remembering to look behind you to enjoy the views back to Canberra). At the end of Burnt Knob Road, turn left on to Dead Horse Gate Road. Another 500m of climbing will bring you to Mt Gumby (the highest point on the course). From here it is all downhill.
    </p>
    <p>Continue down Dead Horse Gate Road (ignoring all side roads) until it merges with Blue Range Road.  At this point make a tight left hairpin turn and continue downhill on Blue Range Road for another 500m. Here you will veer right for the final 200m back to the campsite.</p>
    <p>Get ready to do it all again…</p>
    <p><i>The course will be well marked using a combination of pink flagging tape with reflective tape for night time and directional signage.</i></p>
    <p><i>The flagging tape will be placed around each turn and approximately every 100m along the course (so you know can reassure yourself you are in the right direction).  We will also use A4 sized directional signage, using arrows to indicate directions, and crosses to remind you are going the wrong way!</i></p>
    <p>A gpx file of the course can be downloaded here</p>

    <h2>Event Check In</h2>
    <p>Only athletes will be able to check themselves in. <strong>Please ensure you have some form of ID so we can verify that it’s actually you.</strong> Once checked in you will receive your race kit.</p>
    <h3>Race Kits</h3>
    <p>You will receive the following at the event check in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Race Number Bib – this must be worn at the front at all times and cannot be covered by clothing</li>
        <li>Ankle Timing Chip – this should be worn on your ankle, make sure you are wearing this to ensure your laps are recorded. o	All timing chips must be returned to the race director upon completion of, or retirement from, the event.  Please make sure you or your support crew return the chip</li>
        <li>Welcome gift – something from UMROC to say thanks for attending our event</li>
        <li>Event running shirt – if you pre-ordered an event running shirt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparing for the event and other FAQ answers</h2>
    <p><strong>Road Safety</strong> – the GUMBY course is on public forestry roads so there may be the occasional 4WD coming through (it is a long weekend). For safety reasons runners are not permitted to have headphones whilst they are out on the course. You will also need to wear the mandatory safety gear.</p>
    <p><strong>Mandatory safety gear</strong> – you will need a head torch and a reflective high visibility vest if you are running after 1700.  If you do not have these items you will not be allowed to commence any laps after 1700.</p>
    <p><strong>Getting there</strong> – please carpool if you can, Blue Range Hut is accessible by 2WD vehicle via the dirt Blue Range Road. Please drive to the conditions.</p>
    <p><strong>Fires</strong>– there are half a dozen fire pits at Blue Range Hut, the main fire near the hut will be lit late on Saturday afternoon and kept burning throughout the event. If you want to have a fire in one of the other pits please bring your own firewood.  Scavenging for wood in the forest is prohibited.  Campfires must be attended at all times, we will extinguish a fire if we find it unattended.</p>
    <p><strong>Mobile phone coverage</strong> – the reception out in the Brindabella range is patchy at best and depends on your phone company. The hut itself, sits in a valley and there is no reception there. You will likely be able to get coverage if you are willing to walk 500m from camp to the top of “Facebook Hill”. For runners, there are a number of places along the course where you will be able to get good reception.</p>
